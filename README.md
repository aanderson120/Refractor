# Refracting

* Refracted page for Horiseon

* https://aanderson120.github.io/Refractor/.

-- Description --

* Code was provided without semantic tags and with excessive id tags and classes for CSS. My role was to follow accessibilty standards by add semantic tags, simplify codes, and fix any broken links. While maintaining the look of the page and allowing for optimization for search engines. 

* I started with the semantic tags, which felt the easiest for me, and got the ball rolling. I got stuck fixing the content section and couldn't figure out why the images kept changing or how to get them back. I kept playing with it while looking at the original code and got it to do what I wanted.
